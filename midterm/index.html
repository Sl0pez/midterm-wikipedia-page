		Overview
	</h2>

	<hr>

	<p>
		Tourism makes an important part to the economy of the country. The growth of the economy had been into a major change since the end of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People_Power_Revolution" target="_blank">People Power Revolution</a> up until to the present time because of the tourism growth.
	</p>

	<p>
		In 2000, the Philippines' tourist arrivals totaled 2.2 million. In 2003, it totaled 2,838,000, a growth of almost 29%, and was expected to grow as much as 3.4 million in 2007. In the first quarter of 2007, the tourist arrival in the Philippines grew as much as 20% in same period last year. In 2011, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism_in_the_Philippines" target="_blank">Department of Tourism</a> recorded 3.9 million tourists visiting the country, 11.2 percent higher than the 3.5 million registered in 2010.
	</p>

	<p>
		In 2012, the Philippines recorded 4.27 million tourist arrivals, after the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism_in_the_Philippines" target="_blank">Department of Tourism</a> launched a widely publicized tourism marketing campaign entitled "It's More Fun In the Philippines".
	</p>

	<p>
		The tourism industry employed 3.8 million <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filipinos" target="_blank">Filipinos</a>, or 10.2 per cent of national employment in 2011, according to data gathered by the National Statistical Coordination Board. In a greater thrust by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benigno_Aquino_III" target="_blank">Aquino administration</a> to pump billions to employ 7.4 million people by 2016, or about 18.8 per cent of the total workforce, contributing 8 per cent to 9 per cent to the nation's GDP.

		History
	</h2>

	<hr>

	<p>
		Tourism in the Philippines traces its origins during the ancient times when the first set of people chose to migrate through land bridges, followed by the second set of migrants from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesia" target="_blank">Indonesia</a>, then the last migrants from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borneo" target="_blank">Borneo Islands</a>. All of those created their own kingdoms and tribes within the archipelago. Trade also became part of the tourism as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabs" target="_blank">Arabs</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_people" target="_blank">Indians</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_people" target="_blank">Chinese</a> traded products and goods to the natives. When the islands became part of the territory of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain" target="_blank">Spain</a>, an influx of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaniards" target="_blank">Spanish people</a> migrated, (though still few compared to the ones migrated in South America due to distance of the country.)
	</p>

	<p>
		The tourism industry first flourished during the late 19th to early 20th century due to the influx of immigrants from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe" target="_blank">Europe</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" target="_blank">United States</a>. It was listed as one of the best country to visit in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia" target="_blank">Asia</a> aside from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong" target="_blank">Hong Kong</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan" target="_blank">Japan</a>, earning the nickname "Pearl of the Orient Seas". The tourism declined during and after the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II" target="_blank">World War II</a>, leaving the country with a completely devastated capital. Most immigrants from Europe and US, and some other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filipinos" target="_blank">Filipinos</a> were offered to emigrate to the US. The second wave of tourist influx flourished in the 1970s and early 1980s but declined in the mid 1980s due to the EDSA Revolution, with the average length of tourist stay falling from 12.6 days in earlier years to 8.9 days in 1988. In 1987, tourism growth was slower in the Philippines than in other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Asia" target="_blank">Southeast Asian</a> countries. About 1.2 million tourists visited the Philippines in 1992, which was a record high in the number of tourist visits since 1989.
	</p>

	<p>
		Today, the tourism industry boomed again at the early part of the 2010s after the decline in the previous decade. The country saw an influx of tourists from all over the world, with the help of social media and the creative tagline, the tourism went at its peak and became one of the countries people wanted to visit in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Asia" target="_blank">Southeast Asia</a> with having 3,590,038 million tourists recorded from January to August 2015.

		Threats to the Tourism Industry
	</h2>

	<hr>

	<p>
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism_in_the_Philippines" target="_blank">Terrorism</a> may pose the greatest threat to tourists' safety in the Philippines. While most parts of the Philippines archipelago are relatively safe to visit, certain areas where terrorist cells have been at large are best avoided. The far-southern region is widely known as a no-go zone for foreign visitors. The areas of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindanao" target="_blank">Mindanao</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulu_Archipelago" target="_blank">Sulu Archipelago</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zamboanga_Peninsula" target="_blank">Zamboanga Peninsula</a> are considered dangerous zones. This is because rebel groups like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moro_Islamic_Liberation_Front" target="_blank">Moro Islamic Liberation Front</a> (MILF) are active in these areas and have been held responsible for a number of violent incidents.
	</p>

	<p>
		Certain militant Islamist groups such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Sayyaf" target="_blank">Abu Sayyaf</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jemaah_Islamiyah" target="_blank">Jema'ah Islamiyah</a> are particularly dangerous, since they are responsible for the majority of recent attacks, which have included bombings, piracies, kidnappings and killings of foreign nationals if their government failed to pay the demanded ransom.
